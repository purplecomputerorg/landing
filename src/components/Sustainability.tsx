              Purple Computer is built from the ground up to run smoothly on old hardware.
              A laptop from 2012 with 2GB of RAM runs it beautifully. No lag, no frustration.

              Most "repurpose your old computer" projects struggle because modern software
              demands modern specs. Purple doesn't. It's designed for hardware that's already
              in your home.
